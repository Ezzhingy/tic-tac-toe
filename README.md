# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe game in browser

Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including a tiny bit of JSON). From this project, I learned how to:
- Create a more complex application involving a lot of Javascript and DOM manipulation
- Use the module pattern to structure the JavaScript file
- Manipulate event listeners and modules together to create a flowing application
- Understand public scope, private scope, and closure
- Review the minimax algorithm and effectively implement it into a game of Tic-Tac-Toe
